# Ariake GTK Themes



## The Ariake GTK theme is based on the color scheme for code editors such as: **"VSCode" **, **"Atom"**, etc ... To match my editor with the desktop and to give a uniform appearance I ventured to create this theme and put the predominant colors of the Ariake color scheme to the GKT theme and to the icon theme too. This is my first GTK theme for the Gnome Desktop, I hope you like it and give me a vote if you liked this work.



## Installation of GTK and Icons



### GTK

___Local___

To install the theme you just have to download and extract the files and move the extracted directories to the path: `.themes`

The directories that begin with a dot are hidden directories, to see the hidden directories there are two methods; **the first** is with a combination of keys: `ctrl + h`; **the second** is to go to the **Nautilus or Files** menu and check the box that says: **Show Hidden Files** automatically the hidden files will be shown.
If you can't see the `.themes` folder you should create it and place the directories with the theme files inside the folder.

___Root___

You can place the themes inside the root folder, so they will be available to all users and also the theme will be applied for themes run by the root user, this is not recommended, but it is possible to do it.

First open a terminal and run the command `sudo nautilus` then look for the path: ` /usr/share/themes` and place the theme files inside that directory.

### ICONS

___Local___

To install the icons is the same procedure that we do with GTK themes.
First we activate the view of the hidden files to find, in this case, the `.icons` directory, remember that if the directory is not found you can create it and then put the icon themes into the `.icons` directory and voila, the icons are ready to be used.

___Root___

You can also place the icons in the **root** directory as with the GTK themes and thus apply the themes for the applications run as root user and it is available to all users who are registered in the OS, in case there is more than one user.
And it is the same procedure as for GTK themes, the difference is that you must place the icon themes in the following path: `/usr/share/icons/` and then they will be available to be used by all users.

Well, this is my first contribution of GTK themes and I hope you like it, vote if you liked it, and if you don't like it you can give recommendations instead of negative votes.

## Enjoy!! };-]
