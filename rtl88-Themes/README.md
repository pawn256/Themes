Brought back to the GUI by popular demand, Solarized-Dark - as originally created by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Delivering seven, dark-mode, hue choices for the GNOME-Shell this GUI-centric theme strictly adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-Dark - it is hard to go back to anything else.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

The GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of material and modernized Numix elements, with an overlay centered on one of seven hues from the original standard Solarized-Dark scheme, created by Ethan Schoonover.

Manual Installation Is Easy: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems, to fully implement themes.
